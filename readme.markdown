League Mono
===========
_by [Tyler Finck](https://www.tylerfinck.com)_

**Monospace/variable font fun.** 

League Mono is a mashup of sorts, inspired by some beautiful forms found in both Fira Mono, Libertinus Mono, and Courier(?!). 


May 2018 update: League Mono has been made a variable font:

Use the one TTF file called `LeagueMonoVariable.ttf` for 40 predefined styles of League Mono. Then tweak the weight or width (from condensed – 50 – to extended – 200 - with various weights – 30 through 200).

Play with it at [tylerfinck.com/leaguemonovariable](https://tylerfinck.com/leaguemonovariable/)


Or you can use the OTF / TTF styles (above) for individual weights/widths if you don’t want to deal with the Variable version just yet. I made a cheat sheet:

Personal note: Support for variable fonts is still being implemented across different apps/browsers. 

It is still being refined as of the latest big update: July 14, 2019.
